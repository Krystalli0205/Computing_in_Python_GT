#This problem will make use of the TheaterTicket class you wrote
#in Problem 1. You can copy/paste it into this problem if you want
#to, but you don't need to. When you click Submit, your code will
#be tested with our TheaterTicket class.
#
#Write a function called find_best_ticket. find_best_ticket should
#have three parameters: a list of available tickets (a list of
#instances of the TheaterTicket class), a quantity (an integer),
#and a budget (an integer).
#
#find_best_ticket should return the price of the most expensive
#tickets available from the list that is less than or equal to
#the given budget for the given quantity of tickets. If there are no
#available tickets that come under the budget for the given quantity,
#find_best_ticket should return False.
#
#As a reminder, every instance of TheaterTicket has a method called
#get_ticket_price. get_ticket_price has one parameter, a quantity.
#get_ticket_price returns the cost of the given quantity of that
#ticket. For example, if quantity is 5 and budget is 500, then the
#function would return the largest number to result from calling
#get_ticket_price(5) from each instance in the list of TheaterTicket.
#
#For example, imagine that the customer's budget was $100 for 5
#tickets. The only tickets that could be affordable at this price
#would be gallery seats at the matinee, which are $10 per ticket
#(the next lowest price would be gallery seats at a non-matinee,
#at $30 per ticket or $150, over the customer's budget).
#
#So, if there was a ticket in the list of tickets that with
#'gallery' as the section and True for matinee, then
#find_best_ticket would return $50, the price of five gallery
#matinee tickets. If not, it would return False, since no other
#tickets are affordable.
#
#HINT: You don't need to worry about the inner workings of the
#TheaterTicket class. You just need to find the highest result
#under the given budget from calling get_ticket_price(quantity).


#Write your function here!

#You can do this problem without having direct access to the
#definition of the TheaterTicket class. However, if you would like,
#you may copy your code from Problem 1 here to test your
#function. If you do that, you may uncomment the following lines
#to test your function out. Note that our autograder will use our
#copy of TheaterTicket, not yours; so if your class doesn't match
#the description, your code may work with your class but not with
#ours.

#If you do copy/paste in your TheaterTicket class and uncomment
#these lines, they should print 50, False, 200, 400
