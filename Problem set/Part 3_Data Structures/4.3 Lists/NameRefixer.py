#You've been sent a list of names. Unfortunately, the names
#come in two different formats:
#
#First Middle Last
#Last, First Middle
#
#You want the entire list to be the same. For this problem,
#we'll say you want the entire list to be Last, First Middle.
#
#Write a function called name_refixer. name_refixer should take
#as input the list of strings. You may assume that every string
#will match one of the two formats above: either First Middle Last
#or Last, First Middle. 
#
#name_fixer should return a list of names all structured as
#Last, First Middle. If the name was already structured as
#Last, First Middle, it should remain unchanged. If it was
#structured as First Middle Last, then Last should be moved
#to the beginning and a comma should be added after it.
#
#The names should appear in the same order as the original list.
#
#For example:
#
#name_list = ["David Andrew Joyner", "Hart, Melissa Joan", "Cyrus, Billy Ray"]
#name_fixer(name_list) -> ["Joyner, David Andrew", "Hart, Melissa Joan", "Cyrus, Billy Ray"]


#Add your code here!

    fixed_list = []

            fixed_name = list[2] + ", " + list[0] + " " + list[1]
            fixed_list.append(fixed_name)
        else:
            fixed_list.append(name)
    return fixed_list
